# SDI-Paste

This repository is the official implementation of [SDI-Paste](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13565) - a generative data augmentation regime for Video Instance Segmentation.


SDI-Paste works in two parts: 
    1. Generation of Synthetic Video Dataset
    2. Training of VIS Model

Instruction for each of the parts can be found in the README inside the corresponding folders.

Please cite our paper if this repository has been helpful for your research endeavours.

Happy coding!
